    "## Part 1 problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "(Adapted from [Advent of Code 2021, day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3))\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a list of binary numbers.\n",
    "You need to use the binary numbers in that list to generate two new binary numbers (called the **gamma rate** and the **epsilon rate**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the most common bit in the corresponding position of all numbers in the list.\n",
    "For example, given the following list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "00100\n",
    "11110\n",
    "10110\n",
    "10111\n",
    "10101\n",
    "01111\n",
    "00111\n",
    "11100\n",
    "10000\n",
    "11001\n",
    "00010\n",
    "01010\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering only the first bit of each number, there are five `0` bits and seven `1` bits. Since the most common bit is `1`, the first bit of the gamma rate is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common second bit of the numbers in the diagnostic report is `0`, so the second bit of the gamma rate is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common value of the third, fourth, and fifth bits are `1`, `1`, and `0`, respectively, and so the final three bits of the gamma rate are `110`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the gamma rate is the binary number `10110`, or `22` **in decimal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The epsilon rate is calculated in a similar way; rather than use the most common bit, the least common bit from each position is used. So, the epsilon rate is `01001`, or `9` **in decimal**. Multiplying the gamma rate (`22`) by the epsilon rate (`9`) gives `198`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use the binary numbers in your input list to calculate the gamma rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together.** What do you get? (Be sure to represent your answer in decimal, not binary.)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Using the input file `input.txt`, the result should be 749376._"
