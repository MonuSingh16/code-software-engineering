    "### How to end the `if` block\n",
    "\n",
    "In the solution above, our `if` block compares `command` explicitly to each of the three possible commands, and uses the `else` to raise an error in the event that we receive a command we don't know.\n",

    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if command == \"forward\":\n",
    "    horiz_pos += value\n",
    "elif command == \"up\":\n",
    "    depth -= value\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    depth += value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This block assumes that the variable `command` _always_ contains one of the three known commands, and thus uses the `else` to handle the `down` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a disadvantage to writing code like this:\n",
    "one cannot look at the `if` block and _read_ what is the third case.\n",
    "Is it a single one?\n",
    "Are there multiple commands that map to the action of doing `depth += value`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, one can argue it is preferable to be explicit about the cases we are handling.\n",
    "Of course, we can still choose to write the `if` block like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if command == \"forward\":\n",
    "    horiz_pos += value\n",
    "elif command == \"up\":\n",
    "    depth -= value\n",
    "elif command == \"down\":\n",
    "    depth += value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference, here, is that we do not include the `else` branch with the `raise` statement.\n",
    "This says explicitly the commands that we are handling, while also showing that we do not expect to have to handle anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another slight variant would be to write\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if command == \"forward\":\n",
    "    horiz_pos += value\n",
    "elif command == \"up\":\n",
    "    depth -= value\n",

    "    depth += value\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This variant can be understood to mean “we assume something else might come through in the variable `command`, but we don't care about it”.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just minor variations of one another, and _your_ interpretation might not necessarily align with mine, but I find it to be an interesting exercise to think about the different ways in which similar pieces of code are read and understood.\n",
