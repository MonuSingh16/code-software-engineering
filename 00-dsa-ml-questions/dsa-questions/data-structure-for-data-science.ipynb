    "### Arrays -\n",
    "An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. Elements in an array are typically of the same data type and are stored in *contiguous memory locations*. The index allows for direct access to any element in the array. Arrays can be one-dimensional (a list), two-dimensional (a matrix), or multi-dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Space Complexity\n",
    "The space complexity of an array is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. Each element occupies a constant amount of space, but the total space required is proportional to the number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Time Complexity: \n",
    "Accessing an element in an array by index has a time complexity of O(1), as it involves direct addressing. Insertion and deletion operations may have a time complexity of O(n) in the worst case, as they may require shifting elements to maintain contiguous storage."

    "A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence through a reference or a “link.” Unlike arrays, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, linked lists allow elements to be scattered in memory, connected by these links. \n",

    "This structure enables dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertions, and deletions at any position within the list, and facilitates the creation of various types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "The flexibility of linked lists comes with a trade-off in terms of random access, as accessing an element at a specific index requires traversing the list from the beginning or end, resulting in a time complexity of O(n) for access operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the dynamic nature and ease of manipulation make linked lists valuable in scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions are common, and the size of the data set is not known in advance.\n",
