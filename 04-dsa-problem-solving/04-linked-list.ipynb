    "A linked list is another data structure that is like an array in the sense that it stores elements in an ordered sequence, but there are also differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first difference is that linked lists are made up of objects called `ListNode's`. This object contains two attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `value` - This stores the value of the node, the value can be anything - a character, an integer, etc.\n",
    "2. `next` - This stores the reference to the next node in the linked list. The picture below visualizes the ListNode object. This will make more sense a little later on.\n"

    "> At a lower level, upon instantiation, these objects would get stored in an arbitrary order in the memory. We cannot control the order in which the operating system stores these objects in memory, and for our purpose, it is not very relevant but still good to know.

Again, the traversal itself will take n steps if you do not have the reference to the node . The way to delete a specific node, say y, is to skip over it - update y’s previous node’s next pointer to the node that comes after y. This is called chaining next pointers together.\n",

    "Visualizing this in code makes more sense. Taking the previous example, suppose we want to delete ListNode2. Currently, our head points to ListNode1, and head.next points to ListNode2. Since ListNode2 will cease to exist, we need to update our head.next pointer to ListNode3, which can be accessed by chaining next pointers like head.next.next. This makes sense since head.next is ListNode2, and logically, head.next.next would be ListNode3.\n",
